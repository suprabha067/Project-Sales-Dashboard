Product Sales Dashboards - Internship Project

This repository contains the documentation and insights from my 1-month internship as a "Data Science Trainee Intern" at "SoftCrowd Technologies". The project focuses on the development of "Product Sales Dashboards" to improve data-driven decision-making processes.

Project Overview-
The primary goal of this project was to transform raw sales data into interactive and meaningful visualizations. During the internship, I explored various data tools to analyze order preferences, handle data errors, and create comprehensive reports.

Visualizations Implemented-
The project includes a variety of analytical charts to provide deep insights, such as:

-Trend Analysis: Line, Area, and Stacked Column Charts.

-Distribution & Comparison: Pie, Donut, Funnel, and Ribbon Charts.

-Geographic Insights: Map-based visualizations.

-Advanced Metrics: Gauge and Scatter Charts.

To build effective reports in Power BI, it is essential to understand the three primary panes used to manipulate data and visuals.
1. Visualization Pane: Used to select and customize chart types. Power BI provides automatic suggestions, which can be manually overridden.
2. Filter Pane: Applied to set persistent filters at the visual, page, or report level to ensure data accuracy.
3. Fields Pane: Used to manage data tables and folders, allowing for efficient drag-and-drop visualization building.
